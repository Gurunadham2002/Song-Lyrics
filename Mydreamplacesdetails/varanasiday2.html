                The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages.
                Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.
                Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown.
                Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals.
                Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.
                The city is a center of learning and civilization for over 3000 years.
                Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi,
                it expands to the mighty river that we know of.
                With Sarnath, the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment,
                just 10 km away, Varanasi has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge,
                philosophy, culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts and crafts have all flourished here for centuries.
                Also a pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be the birthplace of Parsvanath, 
                the twenty-third Tirthankar. Vaishnavism and Shaivism have co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously.
