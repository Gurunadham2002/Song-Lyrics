                Kerala, known as 'God's Own Country', is a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India.
                Its enchanting backwaters, lush hill stations, diverse wildlife,vibrant culture,
                and rejuvenating Ayurvedic treatments have made it a popular tourist destination.
                Tourism in Kerala can trace its roots back to the ancient times when it was a key destination for spice traders.
                The port of Muziris was a hub for commerce and interaction with foreigners, leading to early forms of cultural exchange.
                However, the tourism in the form we know today began to take shape only in the colonial period.
                Kerala also took the lead in promoting eco-tourism, inviting travelers to live close to nature while ensuring minimal impact on the environment.
                Destinations like Thenmala and various community-driven initiatives set benchmarks for sustainable tourism practices.
